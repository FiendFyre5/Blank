	I'm a Computer Science, Mathematics and Machine learning enthusiast, working towards a _BS in Computer Science_ at UC San Diego, with an expected graduation date of June 2023.
	 I'm currently doing my research under [Prof Niema Moshiri](https://niema.net/) to build Scalable tools for studying viral evolution. Our research is geared upon inferring properties of a real epidemic using only viral sequences learned from the various dependencies of virus transmissions and the patient's genomic sequences. In my free time, you can find me painting my heart out or **try** hiking.
